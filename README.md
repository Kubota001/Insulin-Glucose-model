# Insulin-Glucose-model
A model reproducing blood glucose levels, blood insulin levels, and glucose uptake during glucose clamp experiments in mice. The model was developed using healthy 14-week-old mice and high-fat-diet-fed mice aged 10, 14, 18, 28, and 36 weeks, with HFD feeding initiated at 5 weeks of age.
